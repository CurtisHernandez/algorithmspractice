#### Genetic algorithm tutorial
#### The tutorial was about guessing a password.
#### Fundamental structure from the following tutorial:

#### FUNCTIONS
# FIRST: we need to figure out how to test the fitness of an individual.

				score+=1
			i+=1

# This is a two-step process.
# We develop a technique for making random words, given some length...

	i = 0
	result = ""
	while i < length:
		letter = chr(97 + int(26 * random.random()))

# ...and use this technique to make a population of a bunch of words. Gen 0.
def generatePopulation(sizePopulation, password):
	population = []
	i = 0
	while i < sizePopulation:
		population.append(generateAWord(len(password)))

# THEN: we make the most eligible bachelors and bachelorettes breed, plus
# a few lucky Steve Buscemis.
# To sort by the Chadness and Stacyness...

#### THE ACTUAL PROCESS
# make the first generation!
gen = generatePopulation(gensize,password)

for begats in range(numgen):
    # sort them by fitness!
    sortedgen = fitnessSortedPopulation(gen,password)
    # pick the lucky ones who get to breed!
    parents = selectFromPopulation(sortedgen,howManyChads,howManyParents-howManyChads)
    # make some babies!
    gen = createChildren(parents,gensize)
    # mutate those babies!
    gen = mutatePopulation(gen,mutProb)    

#### Evaluating this particular timeline
howManyRight = list(x==password for x in gen)
performance = sum(howManyRight)/len(howManyRight)
print('In this particular universe you created, the parameters had a performance value of ' + str(int(performance*100)) + '%.')
